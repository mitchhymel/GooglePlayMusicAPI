 # GooglePlayMusicAPI: An unofficial .NET Google Play Music API		
  		  
This is a C# port of [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi).
  		  
Many thanks to the following projects from which my implementation borrows heavily:		
- [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi)		
- [gpsoauth](https://github.com/simon-weber/gpsoauth)		
- [gpsoauthsharp](https://github.com/vemacs/GPSOAuthSharp)		
- [GoogleMusicAPI.NET](https://github.com/taylorfinnell/GoogleMusicAPI.NET)		
- [MBGmusicSync](https://github.com/leoedin/MBGmusicSync)		
 		
# Warnings		

This is not supported or endorsed by Google.  If Google decides to change their APIs, it could break the functionality of this library with no guarantee that it will be repaired. This is also in Alpha and not well tested, as I wrote it for my own personal use.		


# Usage		
View the GooglePlayMusicClientExample project for examples how to use the library.
